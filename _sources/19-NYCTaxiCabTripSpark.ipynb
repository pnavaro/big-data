However in this case that would be unwise because this data is too large to fit in RAM.\n\nThe data can stay in the hdfs filesystem but for performance reason we can't use the csv format. The file is large (32Go) and text formatted.

The manager allocate resources across applications. Once connected, Spark acquires executors on nodes in the cluster, which are processes that run computations and store data for your application. Next, it sends your application code (Python file) to the executors. Finally, tasks are sent to the executors to run.\n\nSpark can access to files located on hdfs and it is also possible to access to local files. Example:\n\n```py\ndf = spark.read.parquet('file:///home/navaro_p/nyc-taxi/2016.parquet')\n```\n\n### Exercise\n\n- Pick a year and read and convert csv files to parquet in your hdfs homedirectory.\n- **Don't run the python code inside a notebook cell**. Save a python script and launch it from a terminal instead.\nIn Jupyter notebook you won't see any progress or information if error occurs.\n- Use the [`spark-submit`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html) command shell to run your script on the cluster.\n- You can control the log with \n```py\nspark.sparkContext.setLogLevel('ERROR')\n```\nValid log levels include: ALL, DEBUG, ERROR, FATAL, INFO, OFF, TRACE, WARN\n\n**Try your script with a single file before to do it for a whole year.**\n\n**Read carefully the script given above, don't submit it as is. You have to change some\npart of this code**","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","cell_id":"00003-64de320b-50aa-4928-9884-23b77f541459"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Some examples that can be run on the cluster\n\n- Here we read the NYC taxi data files of year 2016 and select some variables.\n\n```py\ncolumns = ['tpep_pickup_datetime', 'passenger_count', 'pickup_longitude', 'pickup_latitude', 'dropoff_longitude', 'dropoff_latitude', 'payment_type', 'fare_amount', 'tip_amount', 'total_amount']\n\ndf = (spark.read.parquet('hdfs://svmass2.mass.uhb.fr:54310/user/navaro/nyc-taxi/2016.parquet').select(*columns))\n```\n\n- Sum the total number of passengers\n```py\ndf.agg({'passenger_count': 'sum'}).collect()\n```\n\n- Average number of passenger per trip`\n```py\ndf.agg({'passenger_count': 'avg'}).collect()\n```\n\n- How many trip with 0,1,2,3,...,9 passenger`\n```py\ndf.groupby('passenger_count').agg({'*': 'count'}).collect()\n```\n\n## Exercise\n\nHow well people tip based on the number of passengers in a cab.

Group by the `passenger_count` column and take the mean of the `tip_fraction` column.\n\n### Cheat Sheets and documentation\n\n- [Spark DataFrames in Python](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/PySpark_SQL_Cheat_Sheet_Python.pdf)\n- [Spark in Python](http://datacamp-community.s3.amazonaws.com/4d91fcbc-820d-4ae2-891b-f7a436ebefd4)\n-  https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html\n\nUse the [PySpark API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html).\n\n- **Write a python program and use `spark-submit`**\n- **Read the parquet files instead of csv files** \n- **Don't forget spark.stop() at the end of the script**","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","cell_id":"00004-1b1bb60b-720d-42f8-8643-7b4812088e73"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Hints\n\n- How to remove rows\n```python\ndf = df.filter(df.name == 'expression')\n```\n\n- How to make new columns\n```python\ndf = df.withColumn('var2', df.var0 + df.var1)\n```\n\n- How to do groupby-aggregations\n```python\ndf.groupBy(df.name).agg({'column-name': 'avg'})\n```\n\nWhen you want to collect the result of your computation, finish with the `.collect()` method.","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","cell_id":"00005-cbfd6d94-01f1-40b7-b047-d662d76f6b88"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercices \n\n1.
